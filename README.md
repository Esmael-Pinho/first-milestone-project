# DragonFly - Space Travel

This is my Milestone Project 1.

DragonFly is a space travel website that allows users to book trips, destinations, to Moons and/or Planets. With only a few clicks, and a small section to obtain more infomations about said Moon and/or Planets.

The website design is responsive so it can be used on any device.

This website uses technologies that I have learned including HTML, CSS.

## Code

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) I used this library throughout the project. Particularly for the [NavBar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/), [buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/), [grids](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#example) and [modals](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/modal/).

Code Institute: I referred to lessons and source code from Code Institute's Web Application Development course. I sourced the, [Bootstrapping Your Next Big Idea With Bootstrap 4](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/a4b90d17e5c94220a0f83f00ce7fa606/7c0e25d1061e47cdae9c492d623bfc65/4?activate_block_id=block-v1%3Acodeinstitute%2BFE%2B2017_T3%2Btype%40video%2Bblock%40f586183b665f4f9295f2c3bd3e3cedc6) for the modal.

[Love Running](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CSE101+2020_Q2/courseware/be0e510a3aca4bccb6e0bba4cf7cf06b/83c6c94d55f44c79a3646810d80ce7a3/), for the hero-image idea, along with the animation.

[CV(Resume)](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/616289d66b5641a3808cc43e53842695/a3bcedac97ea4678953a75f07ffd6931/) from the Walk Through Projects, as inpiration for the  history timeline.

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) I referred to guides on [CSS Images](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_images.asp),  [CSS Card Flip](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp), and [Scroll to Top Button](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp), for the buttons on both moon and planets page that disappear if scrolled more than 20px down.

[BOTB](https://www.botb.com/) used code for the arrow animation on the home page carousel button as well as, on destinations cards.
